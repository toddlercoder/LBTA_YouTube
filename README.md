# [LBTA's YouTube](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/YouTube) code in Swift 4

*Brian Voong* from [letsbuildthatapp.com](https://letsbuildthatapp.com) has great free iOS tutorials, but some are not written in Swift 4. I've seen few comments asking how to fix few issues due to incompatibility with Swift 4 version. 

This git repository will be sharing a working version of each lesson starting from [Lesson 11](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course_video?id=74) of [YouTube's](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/YouTube). 


In case you enjoy LBTA's tutorial, please do support by purchasing paid lessons as they are only $50 each. Paid lessons seem to be coded in up-to-date Swift version.

If LBTA prefers to remove this, please do let me know.
