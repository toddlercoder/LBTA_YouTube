# LBTA's YouTube code in Swift 4

Brian Voong's from letsbuildthatapp.com has great free tutorials, but some are not written in Swift 4. I've seen few comments asking how to fix few issues due to incompatibility with Swift 4, so this git repository will be sharing a working version of each lessions from Lesson 11. 



If LBTA prefers to remove this, please do let me know.
